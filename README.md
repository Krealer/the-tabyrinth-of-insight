# The Labyrinth of Insight

A simple static website for exploring various learning resources and games. The
site is designed for GitHub Pages, follows a mobile‑first approach and now
features a dark theme with polished gradient buttons.

## Structure
- `index.html` – landing page with navigation buttons
- `styles/` – global styles for the site
- `pages/` – individual sections

### Example Layout
```
labyrinth-of-insight/
├── index.html
├── styles/
│   └── main.css
├── pages/
│   ├── languages.html
│   └── coding.html
```

All links use relative paths for easy deployment, and no external assets are required.
