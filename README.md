# Grid Game

A simple 30×30 grid-based pathfinding game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No sprites, no dependencies — pure DOM and styles. The level layout is now handcrafted rather than randomly generated.

### Features
- Responsive design for PC and mobile (click or tap to move)
- A* smart pathfinding
- Handcrafted layout with optional impassable walls
- Smooth animation

### Core Truth Tiles
The game includes 7 symbolic tiles representing deep ideas:

- **∞ Ember of Compounding** – Growth from consistency
- **Ψ Echo of Silence** – The power of quiet
- **👁️ Lens of Attention** – You become what you attend to
- **🔍 Mirror of Bias** – See through your mental filters
- **❓ Questioner's Mark** – Ask better, get better
- **🗺️✖️ Mapless Path** – Trust intuition over the map
- **⚙️ Stone of Momentum** – Action fuels motivation

### NPCs
The world can contain conversational actors. See `NPCs.md` for the first example,
"Greenthought," which introduces dialogue-driven exploration.

### How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click/tap any ground tile — the white player will move toward it.
3. Walls block movement and cannot be clicked.
